										<h2>Hire Me: <br> Riley Andersen</h2>
										<p>I'm just a motivated guy trying to find the right place <br />
										
									</header>
									<p> I’ve been running paid media at various agencies and on a freelance basis since 2017. Paid media has come a long way since I started. I wanted to learn paid media because of it’s direct impact on revenue. If you were the one running the ads, you were the one growing the company. This was the case for many DTC companies of the 2012-2016 era. With the privacy changes of today and the controversy around data usage, this instant company growth through paid acquisition is not what it used to be. <br/> <br/> I would like to find a company that wants to work with me on all things digital marketing, and not just paid media strategy. Being in paid media forces you to be acquisition focused. Unless you are working with huge large brands that have money to burn, you’re not going to run anything unless it’s tied directly to revenue. Due to this, my mind is always revenue focused. I think that is what would make me a great addition to any marketing department. <br/><br/> Please note: I built this site using a HMTL5 template and github. I’m not a coder, and will never claim to be one. I’m just cheap and don’t want to pay a monthly fee for a basic website. Could it be better? Of course! Just know that I’m working on it.  </p>

									<h3>Why I'm A Fan Of Marketing / Creativity</h3>
									<p>I like being creative. I enjoy the process of doing it. Creation from nothing is powerful. It gives you endless opportunities for expression and there will always be a need for creative. As the great Jason Dill said, "There will always be a need for imagery". I know this directly applys to pictoral creative, however I think it gets my point across.</p>
