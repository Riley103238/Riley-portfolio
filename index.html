<h1> HIRE ME </h1>
<img src="docs/profile_picture.jpg" alt="profile picture">
     
<p> Here you'll find all the information about my journey breaking into the tech world. I have no idea what I am doing at this point, but I'm learning and teaching myself as i go along. </p>
     
     <h2> Why Hire Me? </h2>
      
    
<p> I really want to work hard and get compensated for it. One thing that bothers me so much about running paid media for agencies is that your success is not merit based, its based upon the success of your book of business. And Lots of times that book of business was sold by someone who largely has no idea what they are talking about when it comes to marketing. I'm willing to put the work and reap more rewards as I prove myself. </p>       
         
 
<h1 id="Learn"> Why I Want To Learn To Code </h1>
 <ul>
  <li>Better Salary</li>
  <li>No More Managing Plateform Changes</li>
  <li>Agency Work Is More Challenging Than Its Worth</li>
</ul>
 
 <h1 id="struggle"> What Am I struggling with right now (03.05.2022) learning HTML and CSS? </h1>
 
 <p> Really finding a place that teaches you what you need to know, while also letting you get your hands dirty, that's free. I find that I learn best when I can do the things they are teaching me. All of these platforms typically work with some kind of code editor, combined with prompts telling you to perform some kind of action. Some of them keep the quizzes behind a paywall though, so you really don't have a good way to decide if you have taken in the material they are teaching you. </p>
 
 <h1 id="struggle"> You Need A Passion Project (3.14.22) </h1> 
     
 <p> Just talked with someone for a couple hours about breaking into the tech world and doing software development. Main take-a-way I got was to find a passion project and figure out how to build it. Once you've done that, figure out a good way to tell people about it. It needs to be a passion project because thats the best way to be excited going into the interview. I'm realizing now that although I want to get our of running paid media for people, I think a good passion project could be to build a data visualizer that shows people how their ads are performing in facebook. Not sure if this is something I can do or not, but its just an idea. </p>
