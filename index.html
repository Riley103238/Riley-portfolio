 <p> Really finding a place that teaches you what you need to know, while also letting you get your hands dirty, that's free. I find that I learn best when I can do the things they are teaching me. All of these platforms typically work with some kind of code editor, combined with prompts telling you to perform some kind of action. Some of them keep the quizzes behind a paywall though, so you really don't have a good way to decide if you have taken in the material they are teaching you. </p>
