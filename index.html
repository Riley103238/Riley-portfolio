										<h2>Hire Me: <br> Riley Andersen</h2>
										<p>I'm just a motivated guy trying to get out of paid media and into tech<br />
										
									</header>
									<p>I've been running paid media since July 2017. When I interviewed for my first advertising agency position, I told them that I wanted to run Facebook Ads. That was my goal. Work here and eventually learn to run facebook ads. I worked there for 10 months before they let me run Facebook ads. Eventually it turned into Google Ads and that's where my paid media management journey began. Now that I've been working in the field for a while, I've started to feel like I've taped out the potential earnings of it. Unless I want to freelance hardcore forever, or work at a huge advertising agency working 80/hr weeks, there isn't a lot more earning potential. Plus, the privacy policy changes happening are making conversions much harder to track.  </p>

									<h3>Struggles</h3>
									<p>Right now I am just teaching myself how to do this in my off time. I still work full-time in paid media, but want out. Here's where you'll see what I am struggling with currently, and hopefully I can document and show any potential hiring managers (who I hope are reading this) that I'm really trying. I've heard documenting the journey is a crucial part of breaking into tech.</p>
